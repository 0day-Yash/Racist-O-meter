# Racist-O-meter

## Welcome to the Fucking Racist-O-meter!

So, you‚Äôre tired of your friends dropping swears like they're confetti? Or maybe you just want to make sure no one‚Äôs typing any messed-up shit? Well, look no further!

### What the Hell is This?

This is the **Racist-O-meter**. It‚Äôs a Python tool that checks if a given text contains any unwanted, offensive, or just plain rude words. Think of it like a bouncer for your text. If it sees something nasty, it‚Äôll let you know!

### How Does It Work?

1. **Type in Your Shit**: Enter the text you want to check.
2. **Get Results**: It‚Äôll scan the text and tell you if it finds any of those nasty words from our special list.
3. **Stay Clean**: If you‚Äôre worried about your language, this will help you keep your text cleaner than a freshly scrubbed toilet.

### Setup and Run

1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Racist-O-meter.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Racist-O-meter
   ```
3. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python racist_o_meter_gui.py
   ```

### What‚Äôs Inside?

- **`racist_o_meter_gui.py`**: The Python script that does all the heavy lifting.
- **`en.txt`**: The list of offensive words that we use to keep your shit in check.

### Bonus Feature

Ever thought about making a chair that casually electrocutes and kills you if you swear? üòÇ

Imagine this: you‚Äôre sitting in your favorite chair, and every time you let a swear word slip, the chair electrocutes you (or your friend)

**How It Could Work:**

1. **Basic Setup**:
   - **Microcontroller**: Use a microcontroller like an Arduino or Raspberry Pi to handle the logic. This little guy will monitor the input from the Racist-O-meter.
   - **Shock Mechanism**: You‚Äôd need a huge electrical shock device (something harmlful, like a hairdryer coil in salt-water). It can be hooked up to the chair‚Äôs frame or a special pad.
   - **Connectivity**: Connect the shock device to the microcontroller, ensuring it only activates when a swear word is detected.

2. **Building the System**:
   - **Text Detection**: Your Racist-O-meter script will run as usual, detecting bad words in any text input.
   - **Trigger Mechanism**: When a bad word is detected, the script sends a signal to the microcontroller.
   - **Shock Activation**: The microcontroller then triggers the shock device for an hour, successfully electrocuting you (or your friend)!

3. **Additional Fun**:
   - **Customizable**: Add features like adjustable shock intensity, which can prolong the period of one's suffering before he/she eventually dies.
   - **Visual Indicators**: Set up LEDs that light up when the device is active, adding a visual cue to the fun.

Remember, this is just a playful idea and not meant to be taken seriously. Always prioritize safety and respect in real-life applications. üòÅ
